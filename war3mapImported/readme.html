<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moonflies, such wondrous creatures, the soft glow of their flitting wings hiding a deadly peril.  Fore while the moon may sing a lullaby, it is the moonfly who sets the long, cold, sleep of death upon its victim, spreading it's poisonous spores in vast clouds like the twinkling stars above.<br />
